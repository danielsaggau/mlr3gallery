## Intro

The titanic data set is contains information on the survival of passengers on the titanic.
We are using this use case to illustrate basic mlr3 features and the usage of the package `mlr3pipelines`.
This is the first part of the titanic series.
For the second part, see the following page:

* [Part II - Pipelines](/mlr3_pipelines_titanic/)

First of all we are going to load required packages and the data. 
The data is part of the `mlr3data` package.

```{r}
library("mlr3")
library("mlr3learners")
library("mlr3pipelines")
library("mlr3data")
library("mlr3misc")
library("mlr3viz")
library("GGally")
data("titanic")
```

The titanic data is very interesting to analyze, even though it is part of many tutorials and showcases. 
This is because it requires many steps often required in real-world applications of machine learning techniques, such as **feature engineering**, **missing value imputation**, **handling factors** and others.

Following features are illustrated in this use case section:
  
* Summarizing the data set
* Visualizing data
* Splitting data into train and test data sets
* Defining a task and a learner

In order to obtain solutions comparable to official leaderboards, such as the ones available from CRAN, we split the data into train and test set before doing any further analysis.
Here we are using the predefined split used by Kaggle. 

```{r}
titanic_train <- titanic[1:891, ]
titanic_test <- titanic[892:1309, ]
```


## Exploratory Data Analysis

With the dataset, we get an explanation of the meanings of the different variables:

```
survived        Survival
                (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
pclass          Passenger Class
                (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)
name            Name
sex             Sex
age             Age
sibsp           Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard
parch           Number of Parents/Children Aboard
ticket          Ticket Number
fare            Passenger Fare
cabin           Cabin
embarked        Port of Embarkation
                (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
```

We can use the `skimr` package in order to get a first overview of the data:

```{r, R.options=list(width = 120)}
skimr::skim(titanic_train)
```

Here we can also inspect the data for differences in the train and test set. 

```{r, R.options=list(width = 120)}
skimr::skim(titanic_test)
```


This might be important, as shifts in the data distribution often make our models unreliable.

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.height=7}
DataExplorer::plot_bar(titanic_train, nrow = 5, ncol = 3)
```

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.height=4, warning=FALSE}
DataExplorer::plot_histogram(titanic_train, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
DataExplorer::plot_boxplot(titanic_train, by = "survived", nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
```

```{r, }
ggplot(titanic, aes(x = pclass, fill = survived)) +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(
    y = "Number of Passengers",
    title = "Survival Rate by Passenger Class"
  )
```

As we can see there are still a considerable number of mussing values. We will address this concern at a later point in time. 
We can now create a `Task` from our data. 
As we want to classify whether the person survived or not, we will create a 
`TaskClassif`. We'll ignore the 'titanic_test' data for now and come back to it later.

## A first model

```{r}
task <- TaskClassif$new("titanic", titanic_train, target = "survived", positive = "1")
task
```

```{r}
autoplot(task$clone()$select(c("sex", "age")), type = "pairs")
```

Our `Task` currently has $3$ features of type `character`, which we don't really know how  to handle:
"Cabin", "Name", "Ticket" and "PassengerId".
Additionally, from our `skim` of the data, we have seen, that they have many unique values (up to 891).

We'll drop them for now and see how we can deal with them later on.

```{r}
task$select(cols = setdiff(task$feature_names, c("cabin", "name", "ticket")))
```

Additionally, we create a resampling instance that allows to compare data.

```{r}
rdesc <- rsmp("cv", folds = 3L)$instantiate(task)
```

Next we want to create a learner.
To get a first impression of what performance we can fit a simple decision tree:

```{r}
learner1 <- mlr_learners$get("classif.rpart")
# or shorter:
learner1 <- lrn("classif.rpart")

res <- resample(task, learner1, rdesc, store_models = TRUE)
agg_rpart <- res$aggregate(msr("classif.acc"))
agg_rpart
```

So our model should have a minimal accuracy of `r round(agg, 3)` in order to improve over the
simple decision tree.


If we now try to fit a 'ranger' random forest model, we will get an error, 
as 'ranger' models can not naturally handle missing values.

```{r, error = TRUE}
learner2 <- lrn("classif.ranger")
learner2$param_set$values <- list(num.trees = 250, min.node.size = 4)
res <- resample(task, learner2, rdesc, store_models = TRUE)
```

This means we have to find a way to impute the missing values.
For further information, see the second part of the use case:

## Appendix

### R Pro Tips

For the case that you are trying to split a dataset and you dont have predefined instructions, you may use the following command:

```{r}
train_set <- sample(task$nrow, 0.8 * task$nrow)
test_set <- setdiff(seq_len(task$nrow), train_set)
```

* What are the arguments of `lrn()`, `tsk()`, etc. again? -> Think about the corresponding dictionary.

```{r}
mlr_learners
mlr_tasks
mlr_measures
mlr_resamplings
```

* What are the arguments of a `$new()` constructor?

```{r}
formals(TaskClassif$public_methods$initialize)
```

* What are the possible slots and functions of an object?

```{r}
# Writing `pred_rf$`, and pressing <TAB> should work.
# Otherwise:
names(pred_rf)

# try names without `()` first
# and see if it is a function
```

* How do I see the help file of an object

```{r}
# The documentation is organized by object classes
class(pred_rf)

# use ?PredictionClassif, ?Prediction etc.
# Try all elements listed in the class
```
